# Distributed Cloud Applications

## Introduction
This project involves developing a large-scale enterprise application to understand distributed systems and cloud computing. Using Spring Boot, we will build, deploy, and run a Java web application that interacts with distributed servers, utilizing cloud services like Google App Engine for scalability and high availability.

## Goal
The assignment focuses on building a Java web application that handles distributed transactions across independent servers. We will use Spring Boot to accelerate development and optionally deploy on Google App Engine to handle high availability and scalability, using the NoSQL model for data persistence.

### Disclaimer
The code will be uploaded soon, for legal matters.
